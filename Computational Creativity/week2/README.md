Exercise 7
----------
The approach in the previous exercises is a great approach towards the idea of linguistic creativity. In a system which generates poems, this approach could be used to select (either randomly or in some respect systematically) target topics from a given corpora and generate metaphors or other analogies using various templates. 

As the first step of the figurative sentence generation I would define templates for paired lines of poems or verses of poems, such as: 

    {} is {} as {}
    but {}Â never {}
    This life is a {} {}
    But my love is a {} {}

Lines of verses or complete verses could be defined according to such templates and a random or systematic combination of them could give the skeleton of the poems. One could define the length of the lines in terms of syllables and the rhyming schemes (abab, aabb etc). The generation algorithm could pick target topics and look up properties and sources that conform to the rules to fill in the placeholders in the template. Paying attention to the other rules (e.g. rhyming schemes, syllables etc) invalid candidates could be dropped so that only the "syntactically correct" ones are kept for evaluation.
