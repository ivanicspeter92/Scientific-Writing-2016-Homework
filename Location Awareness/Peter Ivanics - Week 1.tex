\section{Location-based Services} 
	In the following subchapters, four Location Based Services (hereinafter LBSs) are introduced briefly. The first three - Commuter, Sports Tracker and Tinder - are consumer applications. They show some similarities in their business model and targeted audience as they freely available for everyone on today's popular mobile platform (iOS, Android and Windows Phone). However, they differ in their functionality as Commuter supports the usage of public transportation, Sports Tracker encourages the community to do physical exercises, while the Tinder is a dating application. The reason for describing these applications is their popularity, different focus and application area. As an active user, I have hands-on experience in all of them. In my opinion these applications are great specimen for this assignment.
	
	The last example is a mobile workforce management platform called Reslink. The reason of choosing this platform is its wide applicability, rich data and different focus compared to the other examples. In comparison to the previous examples, Reslink is a business-to-business platform operating in multiple business verticals. As one of the developers of the Reslink platform I believe that it serves as a splendid example of a LBS in the business field of workforce management. 
	
	\subsubsection{Commuter}
		% What is this solution briefly? Who is the targeted audience? 
		Commuter \cite{com16} is a simple, but tremendously useful application for people living all around Finland. The service allows users to look for routes from point A to point B using the public transportation. As soon as the source and destination is known, the application suggests the fastest transits to get to the destination, which can be by using bus, tram, underground, train or walking. Routes can be planned on demand or in advance by defining the desired arrival time. The starting point for the journey is the current location of the user, but it can be defined differently for each journey, if needed. While on the road, the service guides the user where he/she is currently on the map, shows the upcoming stops and reminds the user for transitions between lines. Figure \ref{commuter_planning} shows an example journey from Kumpula to the center of Helsinki on bus number 722 in the application. The application has many other features, such as listing nearby bus stops, bookmarks, favorite lines, route history, reminders, disruptions, service points and so on. The service is available on iOS devices.

		% How this solution uses location awareness? 
		The application relies very much on the location of the user just like any navigation and transportation service. The user's location is visible all the time in the application even if the starting point of a journey differs. Users are continuously shown their surroundings, such as street map, bus stops, stations and service points. While on journey, it is clearly indicated what the upcoming stops are and how long time it takes to reach the desired destination. The transition between lines could never be easier than with this service as is indicates the distance and direction clearly. All in all, this service greatly enhances the location awareness of the user and helps to reach the intermediate and final destinations.
		
		% How does this solution address the challenges? Lack of standards, Positioning, Power consumption, Privacy
		Commuter addresses the challenges as follows. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lack of standards: the service is focused on one mobile platform as it is available only on iOS devices. From the "About" page in the application it is clear that different public APIs are utilized for the accurate data displayed in the application. This means that the timetables of the public transportation and disruptions are loaded from public data sources. These sources are unknown; there is a possibility that they are different format but yet transparent for the user.
		\item Positioning: the positioning works very accurately as an end-user even without internet connection. Seemingly, the position is updated every couple of seconds, which gets a bit more rapid when on journey. This is logical, because users need more updates while using on public transport than when planning their journey.
		\item Power consumption: as an end-user, the application consumes fairly small amount of battery. The service is limited to access data only from a limited number of sensors. For example, it would not benefit from the usage of the camera or microphones and therefore does not use these accessories at all, which saves some battery power.
		\item Privacy: users are not required to enter any log-in credentials nor e-mail addresses in advance of using the applicaiton. This indicates anonymity as an end-user and homogeneity among the user base. If the service provider collects data concerning users, their identity should remain unknown, however their behavior and habits could be interesting to analyze.

	\subsubsection{Sports tracker}
		% What is this solution briefly? Who is the targeted audience? 
		Sports Tracker is a service that connects location awareness with sports and exercises. The idea is that end-users use the location information generated by their mobile devices to track the route on which they were working out. The data is then visualized on the map, calculate exercise statistics and performance indicators, how long the exercise lasted, how many calories were burned and so on. The results may differ depending on which kind of exercise the user performs, for instance cycling, skiing, jogging or walking. For instance, \ref{sports-tracker-midnight-run.png} shows one of my running workouts. On top of that, the service provides many other features such as integration with social network, sharing workout data, taking and sharing photos, comparison to and competition with other users, notifications about friends' workouts and so on. Each user has a personal profile which can be accessed through a web-based backend platform. The application is available on the three main platforms.

			\end{center}
		\end{figure}		
		
		% How this solution uses location awareness? 
		The application relies very much on the location and accelerometer data of the device. This data is utilized for calculating the number of steps, distance traveled and calories burned during the workout. Obviously, the same data is utilized to visualize the workout-route on the map. Naturally, the application works the best for working out outside, but it can be used for training indoors as well. During a workout users can retrieve detailed information concerning their performance and position which can help them to decide how they would like to proceed with their current workout. 
		% How does this solution address the challenges? Lack of standards, Positioning, Power consumption, Privacy
		The challenges in this case are addressed in the following way: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lack of standards: as the application supports three platforms, the Sports Tracker platform has to have well defined APIs. The mobile clients are surely conform to the end-points and submit the data to the database in the defined format. This is an impressive achievement as it is completely transparent for end-users on different platforms.
		\item Positioning: the positioning is more or less accurate. In the past I personally noticed some errors after looking at my workouts. This indicates that the application attempts to save energy on the cost of accurate positioning, which is a wise decision. Nevertheless, the displayed location information is very relevant and accurate after all in most of the cases.
		\item Power consumption: in my experience, the application consumes moderate amount of battery power. This is not a surprise considering that multiple sensors are utilized for data collection. Interestingly, the application is fully operational without stable internet connection, which indicates trust on fewer sensor data as well.
		\item Privacy: as users have their own training profile and form a community, privacy is a relevant question in this case. The application collects huge amount of data concerning the exercises and individuals' health information, which can violate individuals' views on the question of privacy. For this reason, users can decide if they share workout information to the public, their friends or keep it private. On the other hand, this data can be valuable to indicate healthfulness of users, to detect and avoid potential health-related issues.
