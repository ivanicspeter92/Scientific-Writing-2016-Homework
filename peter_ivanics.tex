\section{Introduction} % \review
	Mobile devices became part of our lives. The number of mobile phones reached more than 4 billion devices worldwide in 2010 already \cite{bau10}. In the present time, almost every person on the planet has at least one mobile device, such as a smart phone or a tablet, which they carry on with themselves all the time, wherever they go. At the same time, new devices are approach the horizon, such as smart watches and glasses, which further increase the popularity mobile devices.
	
	According to Baudisch and Holz, desktop computers are fading into the past \cite{bau10}. Despite all the challenges, such as small resolution, screen size, new interaction techniques, weaker hardware resources etc., many applications that run on personal computers support mobile displays and operating systems. The appreciation from the users' side is storming, because these devices enable them to perform everyday tasks on a device, which is in their pocket \cite{bau10}. 
	
	Mobility has become a key factor, not only for individuals, but businesses as well \cite{wvms06, bud15a}. More and more businesses implement mobile solutions in some ways by providing their employees smart phones in order to perform some (if not all) of their work. Accodring to Buda \cite{bud15a} this means that previous methods, such as paper-based administration is disappearing and being replaced by mobile forms. By bringing the smart phones into the working life of their employees, businesses are moving towards the creation of a mobile workforce. Razip et al. \cite{rma14} agree that the potential and the popularity of mobile hand-held devices is increasing and many businesses started to utilize them recently with the aim to improve business processes.
	
	The goal of a mobile workforce is to become more efficient and productive by replacing the paper-based field operations with mobile solutions \cite{wvms06, bud15a}. However, in many cases the decision makers do not clearly understand the impact and the cost of such change or might not make the best possible choice from the long list of possibilities. This means the there are many different technologies and providers, however not all of the is suitable for every business case. Wang, van de Kar, Meijer and Sol explains \cite{wvms06} that the available solutions are typically not designed for a specific organizational environment and require a lot of adaptation as well as business engineering. In other words, utilization of mobile technologies may have an impact on the organizational structure, processes and individuals' role at a firm. Finally, the new technology brings enormous amount of digital data, which should be analyzed, understood and handled.
	
	This report first introduces the concept of a mobile workforce. Further the study explains the popularity, main goals, challenges and some of application fields of mobile workforce solutions by drawing from relevant literature. The study focuses on visualizing the data generated by a mobile workforce. 
	
	Reslink Solutions is a company situated in Helsinki who provides competitive solutions for mobile workforce management in various business fields. As a case study for mobile workforce management and data visualization, some of the tools and practices in use at Reslink Solutions are presented.

	\subsection{Basic principles and problem sphere}
		Mobile solutions are undoubtedly influental in the present time on a global scale. Case studies show application of a mobile workforce solution in various industries, such as brewery \cite{bud15a}, law enforcement/public security \cite{rma14, pwe09}, public transportation \cite{wvms06} and guarding \cite{bud15b}. The different application fields above prove the flexibility and wide applicability of mobile solutions, furthermore serve as great examples for successful implementation of a mobile workforce. Despite its popularity, mobile workforce solutions are yet growing and may be understood differently by individuals. 
		% what is a mobile workforce? 		
		Techopedia defines mobile workforce as a group of employees at a company, who utilize mobile devices to perform their work in the field, at distributed locations \cite{tec16}. The mobile devices are used because of their powerful capabilities when they are continuously connected to Internet. By utilizing mobile solutions, employees have the possibility to report when they started and finished their work, prove where they have been, take photos or videos of the circumstances and finally report all of this information to the back-office in real time. 
		
		%what problem mobile workforce is intended to solve?
		Depending on the business case the above aspects can be crucial. For example, Razip et al. \cite{rma14} highlights that geographic information systems (GIS) play key role in law enforcement, as police officers can immediately react if they are aware of the location of ongoing incidents. Buda states \cite{bud15a} that in brewery industry, proof of visit is essential - managers have to know, that the delegated maintenance job was performed at their customers. In this case, mobile solutions are enablers for proving a completion of an installation by sending GIS coordinates, taking picture of the installed equipment or by asking a signature of the customer. 
		
		%why are mobile workforce solutions powerful
		Today's mobile solutions offer many other benefits. Employees have the possibility to interact with their fellow colleagues free of charge, navigate between locations easily during their workday, keep track of their tasks and plan their workday through calendar and so on. Razip et al. concludes \cite{rma14} that the goal of such mobile solutions is to improve the day-by-day operations of employees by utilizing the tools and practices above. All in all, in comparison to traditional, paper-based work and administration, mobile solutions offer robust solutions to facilitate business processes. 
		
	\subsection{Challenges}
	Despite all the benefits, mobile solutions bring a lot of challenges as well. Razip et al. explains \cite{rma14} that the small screen size and considerably low hardware resources are limiting the capabilities at first. This means that any data represented on the mobile phones must be compact, easy to understand and simple. While desktop devices have more capabilities in the sense of data representation, mobile devices have limitations, which have to be addressed. On top of that, the users must learn how to interact with the devices and learn the touchscreen-interactions in advance, which may be more challenging for elderly employees. Finally, it must be highlighted that some devices may not be the best decision to perform certain task. For instance, filling a long form on a tablet is certainly less demanding than on a mobile phone, while taking a picture with the camera of the devices is easier the other way around. All in all, before handing the devices over to the employees, it must be analyzed, what kind of tasks they are desired to accomplish.

		\subsection{Crime incident analysis}
			This research addresses the problem and proposes a solution for enhancing public safety based on mobile data collection and analysis. By utilizing this solution, police officers and citizens are able to report incidents (e.g. traffic collisions, interference, violence etc.) from their mobile phones in their surroundings. The system relies on the GIS information retrieved from the mobile phone and registers the incident in a central database. 
		
			The submitted data is available for patrolling officers nearby in real time. This gives the possibility to react to incidents happening on the field immediately. In the back office the shift supervisors have the capability to reallocate officers on patrol, in case an area is overwhelmed with suspicious incidents. Furthermore, all users are able to see statistics of certain areas, incident types, tendencies and forecasts. The solution offers various views to visualize data, such as:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Time Series View: represents the incident on a timeline,
				\item Calendar View: summarizes the incidents for each day in monthly calendars,
				\item Clock View: summarizes the incidents for each hour of a day on the clock.
			\end{itemize}
		
			In addition to that, maps are utilized to display the places where incidents were encountered. The heat map feature allows users to get a clear understanding about areas that tend to be more dangerous in certain time-frames. 
		
			The system is optimized and available on desktop devices, iOS phones and tablets. From the research it is unclear, if there is any support for other platforms, such as Android or Windows phone. Based on the content of the research paper, there is room for improvement in the analytical and forecasting module as well.  \cite{rma14}
