(this version of the abstract is only a draft)
%<Context>
Many software businesses collect enormous amount of data generated by end-users. End-user data incorporates essential information about how users interact with the system of discussion as well as information about the users themselves. Such digital footprints can explain the preferences of users, what kind of content they like, how frequent their activity in the platform is, in what ways they interact with the system and eachother.

%<Objectives>
The goal of this research is to study the potential use of user data in business and research environments with the application of Data Mining methods. Since there is no common understanding on its concept, initially user data is defined. Secondly, it is studied how user data is utilized in related studies and what kind of results can be derived from such dataset. Thirdly, the demographic characteristics of users are put in studied in relation to the content which engages them online.

%<Methods>
The findings are retrieved by reviewing relevant literature. The sources include scientific journals, articles as well as books related to the topic of this study. 

%<Results>
The research papers in the field show various ways how user data can be used. For example, user data of social media sites can reveal what kind of feedback is received from the engaged audience in terms of like activities and comments on the uploaded content. By the application of machine learning, image processing and natural language processing techniques, several researchers have successfully extracted novel results from user data. The reviewed literature clearly suggests the relevance of studying user data.
