%	1.  What is the problem? <Context>
Many software businesses collect enormous amount of data generated by end-users. End-user data incorporates essential information about how users interact with the system of discussion as well as information about the users themselves. For instance, such digital footprints can explain the preferences of users, what kind of content they like, how they interact with the system and eachother or how frequent their activity in the platform is.
%	2.  Why is this problem important? <Objectives>
The goal of this research is to study understand the potential use of user data in business and research environments in the present time with the application of Data Mining methods. Since there is no common understanding on its concept, user data in this research consists of data willingly uploaded by users and generated through their interactions while using the software. The research aims to study how content on the Internet is observed by the users, who access the content. Secondly, it is studied what kind of feedback is received from the engaged audience in terms of like activities and comments to the provided content. Thirdly, the tendencies among the demographic characteristics between users are studied in relation to the content which gets them engaged online.
%	3.  What does your solution achieve? <Methods and objectives>
The foundations for the theoretical basis are retrieved by reviewing relevant literature. The sources include scientific journals, articles as well as books related to the topic of this study. The two former sources are retrieved through online digital libraries, such as the ACM digital library, IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar. After finding the first papers, the snowballing technique was used to retrieve further papers in the field. Furthermore, various keywords were used to obtain related literature in the research area.
%	4.  What follows from your solution? <Results>
The research papers in the field show various ways how user data can be used. Social networking sites and movie databases commonly utilize various statistical and data analysis tools on user data. Results show for instance, that Instagram users typically can be divided into two groups -  generalists and specialists - based on the variety of the content they like in the software. Studies about social media sites in enterprise environments have given insights to the organization on how their employees cooperate and interact by utilizing a set of data mining tools. 
The related studies in the research field demonstrate the relevance of studying user data, both in commercial as well as research environments. By utilizing data mining techniques and statistical measures, researchers can learn the insights of the user data and look at human behavior from a different, novel angle.

%The appendices here are just models of the table of contents and the presentation. Each appendix 
%usually starts on its own page, with the name and number of the appendix at the top. Each appendix is paginated separately.
%
%In addition to complementing the main document, each appendix is also its own, independent entity. 
%This means that an appendix cannot be just an image or a piece of programming, but the appendix must explain its contents and meaning.
