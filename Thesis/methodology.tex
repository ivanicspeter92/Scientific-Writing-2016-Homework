% literature review
The research consists of theoretical and a practical part. The foundations for the theoretical basis are retrieved by reviewing relevant literature. The sources include scientific journals, articles as well as books related to the topic of this study. The two former sources are retrieved through online digital libraries, such as the ACM digital library, IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar. After finding the first papers, the snowballing technique was used to retrieve further papers in the field. Furthermore, various keywords were used to obtain related literature in the research area. Keywords included, but were not limited to "data mining", "social media", "user data", "user behavior" and "demographic characteristics". 

% practical part
In the practical part of the study, the data contained of the Choicely voting platform's databases is analyzed. The analysis is fundamentally focused on two topics: the content uploaded by contest organizers and the users' data during the usage of the platform. The methods chosen for performing the analysis are [Method1, Method2, Method3] %TODO
The choice behind these techniques is the successful application of these in previous research. 

% data collection if needed % TODO add stuff if needed
The data for this research is provided by the case company. The chosen techniques are applied and the analysis is performed on historical data, which was gathered through contests and votes in the past by Choicely and its customers. The structure and the properties of the data at hand is explained in the Chapter \ref{section::data-mining-at-choicely} to follow.

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item in case the currently available data is not sufficient or incomplete, data can be gathered by volunteers (e.g. students and staff from the university)
%     \item the data collection can be done through the Choicely platform \url{http://choicely.com} online,
%     \item if needed, multiple sessions can be organized in the Choicely office or Kumpula for the data collection,
%     \item training material for the participants can be provided in written form or a training session can be organized if needed,  
%     \item Choicely is ready to reward the participants in the study with movie tickets or some other small gifts and hence encourage more to participate.
% \end{enumerate}

% Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To grasp on the currently available data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is utilized as the first step of the research. A comprehensive overview on the data related to the most important entities in the Choicely platform is performed by calculating basic statistical measures and visualizing the data. Such entities are the user profiles, the contests, contest participant and the votes performed by users on the contest participants. The findings of the EDA are then utilized to determine how to prune the data such that the acquired sample is representative, does not contain redundant nor faulty data. The results of the EDA are explained in the next chapter. 

% Preprocessing and pruning
Based on the results from the EDA, a subset of contests is chosen for more careful analysis. The subset of the contests is limited to those, which have engaged the most users and gathered a higher enough number of votes and unique voters (users who have voted at least once in the contest). After applying the pruning rules, some part of the data is preprocessed so that the analyses can be performed easily. The pruning rules and preprocessing steps are explained in the next chapter. 

% Association Analysis
More importantly, Association Analysis is performed on the combined demographic, vote and the image label data in the chosen contests. The list of labels extracted from the participants in the contest are listed for each of the voters' transactions alongside with the voters' demographic data. The data retrieved from the three sources is combined as shown in Table \ref{association_analyisis_data}. Frequent Itemset Analysis is then performed on the data to identify behaviors and preferences of the different demographic groups. Association Rule Discovery is performed on the same data to understand which pair of traits can engage more of the (targeted) audience.
