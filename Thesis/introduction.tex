\subsection{Background and motivation}
    % context, setting - B2C business gathers a lot of data
	Many software businesses collect enormous amount of data generated by end-users. End-user data incorporates essential information about how users interact with the system of discussion as well as tells a lot about the users themselves. For instance, such data can explain the preferences of users, what kind of content they like, how they interact with the system and eachother or how frequent their activity in the platform is.
    
    % what is the challenge?
    Depending on the portfolio of the business, analysis of end-user data can reveal various interesting findings. For instance, in banking industry Big Data tools are often used to analyze demographic characteristics to maintain and establish new client relationships \cite{chinesemobilebankingusers, bigdatamanagementrevolution}. Extracting the information from the data is challenging: most businesses are to collect more data than what is humanly possible to process and to analyze \cite{inmon2007tapping, wegener2010integrating}. As a result, significant part of the knowledge might remain hidden and hence business-critical information remains unseen \cite{inmon2007tapping, wegener2010integrating, introtodatamining, chinesemobilebankingusers}. As a result, there is a growing need for all businesses to introduce data analysis processes in their daily activities with the aim of understanding users and data generated by them better.
    
    % how do mobile devices have an impact on the amount of data? 
    With the continuous growth of mobile devices in numbers, the amount of data increases significantly. Due to the wide availability and commonness of smart phones and tablets, anybody can easily generate rich location, media or textual data. Complementary to the popularity of mobile devices, social media sites have grown a lot in the past years \cite{ottoni2013ladies, hu2014we, bakhshi2014faces}, allowing users rich ways of interaction. These facts further increases the call for research in the field of mobile and user data analysis, because it can help researchers to understand the society, human behavior, preferences and public opinions better.  

	% what is the potential in analyzing user data? why is it important not only to collect but also analyze data?
    Data analysis tools and methods already exist to help businesses to process user data. However, these applications often not utilized, because companies rather focus on developing their service package than understanding the previously gathered data \cite{inmon2007tapping, bigdatamanagementrevolution}. As a result, essential knowledge concerning previously collected data is neglected, which would be key for the future development of the business. Careful data analysis may reveal interesting relationships and point out facts, what human eyes would never notice otherwise. Consequently, Knowledge Discovery in Databases is important and is essential part of Business Intelligence applications as well \cite{zarsky2002mine, bigdatamanagementrevolution}. 
    
    % what is the goal? what is this thesis about?
    The goal of this research is to study understand the potential use of user data in business and research environments in the present time with the application of Data Mining methods. The research aims to study how content on the Internet is observed by the users, who access the content. Secondly, it is studied what kind of feedback is received from the engaged audience in terms of like activities and comments to the provided content. Thirdly, the tendencies among the demographic characteristics between users are studied in relation to the content which gets them engaged online. More specifically, the Choicely voting/audience engagement platform is taken as a case study. Association analysis, statistical methods and computer vision are utilized to understand the online content and to reveal yet unseen details about the tendencies of user preferences in terms of votes spent on contest participants in the platform.
    
    % why is this research conducted, what is the motivation from researcher's pov? 
    One reason behind conducting this research are the stimulating challenges about studying user data and the wide possibilities of the information that may lie around in databases. Previous research have proven the relevance of statistical analysis on data, such as like activities \cite{jang2015noreciprocity, jang2016teensengagemorewithfewerphotos, ottoni2013ladies, guy2016whatsyourorganizationlike, jang2015no}, user comments \cite{jang2016teensengagemorewithfewerphotos}, tags \cite{jang2016teensengagemorewithfewerphotos} and image content \cite{hu2014we, bakhshi2014faces} by revealing interesting findings about user behavior. Moreover, as service providers often get access to user demographics-related data through social network sites in the present time, new possibilities become available to seek correlation between user segments. 
    %, based on gender or location for instance. 
    Studies conducted in this field are also interesting from the point of view of human behavior research, which is another motivation towards conducting studies in this area. 

    % what is the motivation behind the focus from Choicely's point of view? 
    From the perspective of the case company and its customers such research is interesting, because it helps the company's management and customers to

        \item have more advanced quantifiable means on the collected data,
        \item gain an understanding on the users' behavior, 
        \item increase business value.
    \end{itemize} 

\subsection{Research questions and methodology}
    In this section, the research questions are presented and described. The questions are as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=RQ\arabic*:]
        \item \textbf{What kind of content is more engaging for users and draws the most attention in the Choicely platform?} The aim of this research question is to understand which type of voting contests tend to engage more audience. Secondly, the question targets to analyze the attributes of those contestants, who received high number of votes. In other words, the aim is to find common features of contestants, who are highly rated by public opinion.     
        \item \textbf{What are the behavioral characteristics of users by location and gender?} This research question targets to answer the question how users tend to use the platform. This covers the analysis of what kind of content users seek, how the votes are spent and what similarities can be observed in the data. To gain more specific understanding, the users will be grouped by their gender and location data.  
        \item \textbf{Is it possible to recommend relevant content for users based on prior user data?} The question targets to investigate and develop methods which can help users to find new content in the platform relevant to their interests.
