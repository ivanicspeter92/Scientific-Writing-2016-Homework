\subsection{Background and motivation}
    % context, setting - B2C business gathers a lot of data
    Many software businesses collect enormous amount of data generated by end-users \cite{chinesemobilebankingusers, bigdatamanagementrevolution, inmon2007tapping}. End-user data incorporates essential information about how users interact with the system of discussion as well as tells a lot about the users themselves \cite{jang2015noreciprocity, hu2014we, jang2016teensengagemorewithfewerphotos, han2016teensarefrommars, socialdiversityongithub}. For instance, such data can explain the preferences of users, what kind of content they like, how they interact with the system and eachother or how frequently they use the software that has generated the data \cite{youyou2015computer, ottoni2013ladies}.

    % what is the challenge?
    Depending on the portfolio of the business, analysis of end-user data can reveal various interesting findings. For instance, in banking industry Big Data tools are often used to analyze demographic characteristics to maintain and establish new client relationships \cite{chinesemobilebankingusers, bigdatamanagementrevolution}. Extracting the information from the data is challenging: most businesses are to collect more data than what is humanly possible to process and to analyze \cite{inmon2007tapping, wegener2010integrating}. As a result, significant part of the knowledge might remain hidden and hence business-critical information remains unseen \cite{chinesemobilebankingusers, inmon2007tapping, wegener2010integrating, introtodatamining}. The computational methods of today's world enable us not only to achieve previously impossible tasks, but also to create tools that may outperform humans \cite{youyou2015computer}. Accordingly, there is a growing need for all businesses to introduce data analysis processes in their daily activities with the aim of understanding users and data generated by them better.

    % how do mobile devices have an impact on the amount of data? 
    With the continuous growth of mobile devices in numbers, the amount of data has increased significantly. Due to the wide availability and commonness of smartphones and tablets, anybody can easily generate rich location, media or textual data \cite{jang2016teensengagemorewithfewerphotos}. Complementary to the popularity of mobile devices, social media sites have grown a lot in the past years \cite{hu2014we, ottoni2013ladies, bakhshi2014faces}, allowing users rich ways of interaction. Due to the combination of these two trends, users leave digital footprints as location, media, numerical or textual data in numerous places around the Internet \cite{youyou2015computer}. People often express their opinion by sharing, liking or commenting on data over social networks. Study shows, that algorithms can predict users' personality traits using such data more reliably than other humans would do \cite{youyou2015computer}. These facts further increase the call for research in the field of user data analysis, because it can help researchers to understand the society, human behavior, preferences and public opinions better.

    % what is the potential in analyzing user data? why is it important not only to collect but also analyze data?
    Data analysis tools and methods already exist to facilitate processing user data. However, these applications often not utilized, because companies rather focus on developing their service package than understanding the information gathered in the past \cite{bigdatamanagementrevolution, inmon2007tapping}. Study shows also that Knowledge Discovery in Databases is important and is interesting topic in research as well as business environments as well \cite{bigdatamanagementrevolution, zarsky2002mine}. It is commonly known, that the utilization of data analysis and Data Mining tools can allow the automatic detection of patterns and interesting relationships in the data \cite{introtodatamining, Friedman97datamining}, which is a big advantage towards analyzing large datasets using Data Mining techniques. 
    
    % what is the goal? what is this thesis about?
    The goal of this research is to study the potential use of user data in business and research environments in the present time with the application of Data Mining methods. More specifically, the goal of this thesis work is to understand what kind of use cases were reported in the relevant literature in this area. In order to do that, the research aims to study how content on the Internet is observed by the users and how users interact with various software solutions which present the information to them. Secondly, it is studied what kind of feedback is received from the engaged audience about the presented content in terms of emotional reactions, like activities and comments. Thirdly, the tendencies among the demographic characteristics between users are studied in relation to the content which gets them engaged online. More specifically, the Choicely voting/audience engagement platform is taken as a case study. Association analysis, statistical methods and computer vision are utilized to understand the online content and to reveal yet unseen details about the tendencies of user preferences in terms of votes casted on contest participants in the platform. This is done with the aim of improving the quality of service provided by the company such that customers of the firm can analyze the data they have collected from users of the solution.
    
    % why is this research conducted, what is the motivation from researcher's pov? 
    One reason behind conducting this research are the stimulating challenges about studying user data and the wide possibilities of the information that may lie around in databases. Previous research have proven the relevance of statistical analysis on Big Data, such as like activities \cite{jang2015noreciprocity, jang2016teensengagemorewithfewerphotos, ottoni2013ladies, guy2016whatsyourorganizationlike, jang2015no, youyou2015computer}, user comments \cite{jang2016teensengagemorewithfewerphotos}, tags \cite{jang2016teensengagemorewithfewerphotos}, image content \cite{hu2014we, bakhshi2014faces} and movie ratings \cite{saraee2004data, kabinsingha2012movie} by revealing interesting findings about user behavior. Moreover, as service providers often get access to user demographics-related data through social network sites in the present time, new possibilities become available to seek correlation between user segments. Studies conducted in this field are also interesting from the point of view of human behavior research, which is another motivation towards conducting studies in this area. 

    % what is the motivation behind the focus from Choicely's point of view? 
    The motivation behind this research from the case company's perspective is mainly oriented towards enhancing the already existing service package that is provided to customers. As the amount of data collected by the company is too large to analyze manually, the application of Data Mining techniques assists the firm and its customers to

\subsection{Introduction to the Choicely voting platform}
\label{section::introduction-to-the-choicely-voting-platform}
    % what does the company do? 
    Choicely\footnote{\url{http://choicely.com/}} is a voting platform developed by the Finnish Choicely Ltd (formerly known as Lovented Ltd) since 2014. The software provides the possibility for users to engage in interesting contests by voting on their favorite contender. The platform has already hosted numerous contests in various fields, such as beauty pageants, public polls, design contests, talent shows, sport events among many others. The customer base of the firm consist of mainly Finnish broadcasters, publishers, advertisers and beauty pageant organizers. Despite having the core customer base in Finland, the recent years have brought numerous users and customers from all around the world. 
    
    The platform is able to host any kind of visual contests or poll. There can be arbitrary number of  participants in the contests. Participants must have at least one image and a name attached to them in order to enter the contest. The voting rules can limit the number of votes that users can cast in a contest as well as on individual participants.

    % how can one reach a contest in the platform?
    Users can access contests through multiple interfaces (Figure \ref{choicely_platforms}). Naturally, the company's webpage provides a convenient way to create, browse and participate in contests. Choicely also has free mobile applications available on Android and iOS devices, that can be installed through the Google Play\footnote{\url{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.choicely.android}} and the iOS App Store\footnote{\url{https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/choicely/id1158798364}} on the devices. Users can create and cast votes in contest on any of these platforms. Users may vote in arbitrary number of contests. Users may vote and participate in their own contests if they like.
    
    The company offers a web widget, which can be embedded as a framework in any webpage easily. The widget is often used by Choicely's customers, because it provides a convenient way to embed rich content in their own web pages, which users are already familiar with. Contests cannot be created through the widget, but users can cast votes the same way as they would on any other platforms.

            \label{choicely_platforms}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure} 

    % other contest-related data
    Contests also have some meta data which can facilitate data analysis. Each contest belongs to at least one but up to three of the following categories: "animals", "beauty", "danger", "design", "entertainment", "fashion", "food", "games", "humor", "sports", "travel", "other". The category labels are aligned by the contest's author upon creation. Contests also have starting and an ending time, between which users can vote or participate in them. While votes arrive into a contest, the vote count value tells the number of total votes received, while the number of unique voters tells how many individual users have voted in the contest.

            \label{vote_trick_of_the_day}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    % other contest participant-related data
    One important fact to point out is, that the contestants have no meta data other than in which contest they are contending. Information about contestants is limited to the contest they contend in, their names, short descriptions, image and video. One of the limitations of the platform is to facilitate information about the contest participants and their traits. 
    
    % state some challenges
    There is currently no way of knowing if there is a tendency in what kind of participants tend to be more engaging to the audience. Secondly, there is yet no possibility to know if there would be a similarity or difference in target groups behavior in terms of what kind of content they spend votes on. The goal of this thesis work from the company's perspective is to address these challenges by developing a data analysis framework that addresses these gaps.
