\section{Topic}
	% context, setting - B2C business gathers a lot of data
	Many software businesses collect enormous amount of data generated by end-users. End-user data incorporate essential information about how users interact with the system of discussion as well as tell a lot about the users themselves. Due to the size of the data, a significant part of the information might remain hidden and therefore the business-critical information remains unseen. 
	
	% what is the potential in analyzing user data? why is it important not only to collect but also analyze data?
	Data analysis tools and methods already exist to help businesses operate on their data. However, these applications often not utilized, because companies rather focus on developing their service package than understanding the previously gathered data \cite{inmon2007tapping}. As a result, essential knowledge concerning previously collected data is neglected, which would be key for the future development of the business. Careful data analysis may reveal interesting relationships and point out facts, what human eyes would never notice otherwise. Consequently, Knowledge Discovery in Databases on user data is important and is essential part of Business Intelligence applications \cite{zarsky2002mine}. 

\section{Goals}
	The concepts and principles of Business Intelligence (BI) and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) will be discussed by reviewing relevant literature. This research work explains how KDD and BI tools can help businesses to understand their domain better. This research analyzes what data mining methods and techniques have proven to be the useful in the setting of BI and KDD \cite{bose2001business}. The work aims to analyze practices and previous case studies how it is possible to discover hidden patterns in databases to understand more knowledge about users and their data. 
	
	The major part of this research work will will be developing novel data analysis for Choicely. Choicely is developing a voting platform for media publishers and advertisers, which is used by thousands of users worldwide. The available data consists of anonymous user demographics, contests/sweepstakes (for example talent shows, beauty pageants, sport events or design contests), the votes spent on  contests and the purchases made in the platform. 
	
	The tools developed via this research work will serve the following purposes: 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item correlation analysis between user demographics and expressed opinion, 
		\item visualization of the data,
		\item prediction of future trends.
	\end{itemize}
	
	The findings will be put in relation to the business domain of the firm. An expected outcome of the thesis work is a software, which can automatically detect and track hidden patterns and changes in the data. The software would be able to visualize the data in a way it is easy to interpret and therefore helps managers understanding the composition of their targeted audience. For example, an interesting development area would be to find correlation between the contestants' images, the amount of received votes and the voters' demographic composition. In case the research area seems to be too wide, the analysis could be reduced to location areas, brands or contest categories in Choicely's platform. To preserve anonymity, contests with sufficient number of engaged users (for instance over 100) will be included in the analysis. 
	
\section{Methods}
    The basis of the theoretical framework will be retrieved through review of relevant literature. The research is oriented towards topics in computer science and data mining over business-related topics. References include material on practices in the field of data mining \cite{witten2016data, introtodatamining, inmon2007tapping, bose2001business, data_mining_and_knowledge_discovery, datamininginbusinessprocesses} and similar case studies from the field of data analysis \cite{data_mining_in_educational_science, monetisingusergeneratedcontent, zarsky2002mine, saraee2004data}. The material will be retrieved from online digital libraries, such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and Google Scholar.

	The practical side of the research will include comparison of multiple approaches to solve the tasks, description of the development process, evaluation of the results and analysis of the findings. The thesis will explain the process of the work, derive the findings from reviewed literature and apply various techniques on the data given at Choicely. The thesis will  

\begin{itemize}
    \item introduce the structure of the relevant data,
    \item describe what kind of preprocessing methods were utilized (if any),
    \item analyze which data mining methods can be utilized to extract correlation and hidden patterns from the data, 
    \item explain the development process, challenges and solutions,
    \item evaluate the efficiency of the methods and the relevance of the findings from the point of view of customers and business, 
    \item explain how the scope and focus of the work shaped and what the reasons behind the underlying decisions were.
