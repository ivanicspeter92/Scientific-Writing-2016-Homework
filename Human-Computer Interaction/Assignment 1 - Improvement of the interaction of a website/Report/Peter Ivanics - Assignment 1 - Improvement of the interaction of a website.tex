\section{Introduction}
	This short report contains a heuristic evaluation and improvement of a simple one-page website. The report is rolled out as one of the assignment of the Human-Computer Interaction course and serves the purpose to gain hands-on experience with the course material. The given webpage of discussion is displayed on Figure \ref{original_webpage}. 
	
	\begin{figure}[h]

	\end{figure}

	As shown, the webpage includes a very simple web form with the purpose of user registration for a service .The page has a title, a couple of labels and textboxes and a button in the bottom which is supposed to validate and submit the data if all fields are filled correctly by the user. The next chapter of this report describes the heuristic evaluation of the website, which means listing the proposed suggestions, improvement possibilities, design ideas and features for this simple form. Further, a short description about the implementation is given which is based on the former evaluation. Finally, the last chapter concludes the report and describes further improvement possibilities for the website.

%The appendices here are just models of the table of contents and the presentation. Each appendix 
%usually starts on its own page, with the name and number of the appendix at the top. Each appendix is paginated separately.
%
%In addition to complementing the main document, each appendix is also its own, independent entity. 
%This means that an appendix cannot be just an image or a piece of programming, but the appendix must explain its contents and meaning.
