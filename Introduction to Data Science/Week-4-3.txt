Exercise 3
----------
The difference between pseudonymisation and anonymisation is that the former aims to transform data based on a predefined pattern (such as encoding algorithm or hashing). Such transformation may make the data hard to understand for humans, but the original data is still reversible. Anonymisation is a similar transformation, but ensures that the steps are irreversible and the (personal) data will not be identifiable.
