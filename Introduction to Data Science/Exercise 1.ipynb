Fitting a model to predict the training set perfectly is in most cases trivial, and is a simple exercise in [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization). In machine learning, however, we are interested in _generalization error_, or in other words, how well our model works on previously unseen data.
